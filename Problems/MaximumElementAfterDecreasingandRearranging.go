package main

// Given an array of integers arr
// Perform some operations (possibly none) on arr so that it satisfies these conditions:
// 1. The value of the first element in arr must be 1.
// 2. The absolute difference between any 2 adjacent elements must be less than or equal to 1.
// There are 2 types of operations that you can perform any number of times:
// 1. Decrease the value of any element of arr to a smaller positive integer.
// 2. Rearrange the elements of arr to be in any order.
// Return the maximum possible value of an element in arr after performing the operations to satisfy the conditions.
import "sort"

// This solution works by sorting the array and then iterating through it.
